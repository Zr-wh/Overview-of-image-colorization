ABSRTACT:

Image colorization is a computer-assisted technology to colorize grayscale images. With the rapid development of information technology and increasing image data, the study of image colorization has also become particularly important. Through the summary and analysis of related literature in recent years, the paper presents a review about the techniques of image colorization. In addition, we also divide image colorization methods into three categories, then describe their representative methods and applications, and discuss their advantages and limitations in future development trends. The results show specially that model based colorization has a better colorization effect than other methods, whether in terms of image quality or real-time performance.
